    "<p>In this project, we are going to found a automatic way to see the cluster of the ethnic group in a area.  In many times, only the local people know which area in the city is for Certain group.  Fox example, there are Chinese Town, Korea Town, or Japanese town in every city.  However, this information is not shown on the map.  If I were the new real estate agent and looking for place for my client, I would want to know which area is best suite for my client.  Most new homeowner would prefer to live nearby their cultural group.  If a newcomer of the city try to settle, it would take trial and error to found out actually the first place that he or she choose may not be the best ideal place that he would like to live in.  This project is to explore a machine learning way to show the hidden information of ethnic gathering group.</p>"
